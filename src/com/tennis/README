This README file goes over some of the things about the TennisGame program.
This game does not include a main file as it is purely test based.

There are 3 classes. TestGame which holds the test cases. Player with is for the player objects. And game which
simulates the score.

The game contains 2 players. The players will play a match of Tennis. The first one to reach 4 point and have more than
2 points more than the opponent will win.

The scoring system is as follows:
0 = love
1 = fifteen
2 = thirty
3 = forty

When scores are tied at 3 or more the score = duece.
When one player leads by 1 and both scores are 3 or more the score = advantage "name of player".
